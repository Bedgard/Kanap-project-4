> **Project 5 – OpenClassrooms Web Developer Path**

Kanap is a stylish furniture brand aiming to go digital. This project challenges you to build the entire dynamic part of their new e-commerce website using **only vanilla JavaScript** — no frameworks or external libraries.

You are responsible for creating a fully functional shopping experience: managing a product catalog, a shopping cart, and submitting orders via a custom backend.

## Project Overview

You are joining a web development agency and have already demonstrated proficiency with HTML and CSS projects. Now, it is time to take on a more advanced challenge.

Your mission: **Develop the frontend logic** (JavaScript) for Kanap's online shop. The HTML and CSS are already designed and provided.

### Deliverables:

- Dynamic product listing fetched from the backend API
- Shopping cart functionality persisting with LocalStorage
- Form validation with clear error messages
- Order confirmation page displaying the unique order ID
