> **Project 5 – OpenClassrooms Web Developer Path**

Kanap is a stylish furniture brand looking to go digital. This project challenges you to build the entire dynamic part of their new e-commerce website using **only vanilla JavaScript** — no frameworks or external libraries.

You are responsible for creating a fully functional shopping experience: managing a product catalog, a shopping cart, and submitting orders via a custom backend.
